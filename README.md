# Electricity-billing-system-using-ADAPTER# Assignment 2

##### Each team has a topic along with a description. Choose one of the design patterns below;

##### ● Adapter

##### ● Bridge

##### ● Composite

##### ● Decorator

##### ● Flyweight

##### You are not required to develop the project (for example, if the project is about to create an

##### Android app, then it does not mean that you have to create an Android project. It means you

##### should take into account the aspects of mobile development when creating your classes). It is

##### about implementing the design pattern within the context of the project. You may choose any

##### feature (functionality) of your project. If you think the description does not contain a feature to

##### implement the design pattern, you are free to add a feature to the project within the context of the

##### topic.

#### Your work should contain the followings;

##### 1. UML class diagram - (weight 35 %)

##### 2. Code - (weight 50 %)

##### 3. Report - (weight 15 %)

#### Steps

##### 1. Create a UML diagram (preferably in draw.io) for a given topic.

##### 2. Implement the UML using Java.

##### 3. Write a report describing steps 1 and 2. Moreover, the reasons as to why the team chose

##### the design pattern.

#### Each team needs to submit a zipped folder containing the following;

##### 1. UML class diagram in image or pdf format (if it is too big, then you can put a link to the

##### UML diagram in yourreport).

##### 2. A report in pdf format.

##### 3. A zipped file containing the source code (written in JAVA).


### How can our team obtain a high grade?

##### ● UML class diagram: the fields/methods are implemented logically according to the

##### feature (no need to define many fields/methods, include only the necessary). In the event

##### there are primitive types, the types should be consistent with:

##### https://www.uml-diagrams.org/data-type.html.

##### ● UML class diagram relationships: the relationships between classes should also be

##### defined (if there is an association, include it). Look at here:

##### https://www.uml-diagrams.org/class.html. If thereis a relationship between different

##### classes, indicate them in class field/method(for example, if class A has the instance of

##### class B, then indicate class B as a field in class A).

##### ● OOP principles: OOP principles should be followed when implementing UML to Java

##### code.

##### ● Consistency: source code should be consistent with your UML diagram.

##### ● Running your project: provide steps for executing your project.

##### ● Methods and properties: ensure the methods and properties in the UML diagram are

##### included in your code.

##### ● Java code conventions: source code written should follow the java coding convention

##### when implementing the UML diagramhttps://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html.

##### ● Your report clearly and shortly justifies why you chose the particular pattern and

##### describes the job you have done in UML and your code. Avoid grammar and typos to

##### make it easy to understand what you are doing and attention to detail.

##### ● Programming language restrictions: you can only use pure Java in your code (no

##### frameworks, no libraries, no dependencies).

#Electricity billing system

The main task of designing software is to automate something with greater efficiency. In our day-to-day lives,
one of the biggest systems that are in dire need of automation is the billing system for electricity. Till today,
bills are generated manually after readings are taken. Work done to automate reading meters and generating
bills will go a long way in ensuring work is done in the most efficient way possible while ensuring accuracy in the
numbers quoted on the bills.
